* Add CFLAGS='-fPIC' for libtool. Fix TDS version configs in our ports file. Document. Fixes #45

* Update our TDS version constants to reflect changed 8.0/9.0 to 7.1/7.2 DBLIB versions in FreeTDS
  while making it backward compatible, again like FreeTDS. Even tho you can not configure FreeTDS with
  TDS version 7.2 or technically even use it, I added tests to prove that we correctly handle both
  varchar(max) and nvarchar(max) with large amounts of data.

* FreeTDS 0.91 has been released. Update our port scripts.

* Add test for 0.91 and higher to handle incorrect syntax in sp_executesql.

* Returning empty result sets with a command batch that has multiple statements is now the default. Use :empty_sets => false to override.

* Do not raise a TinyTds::Error with our message handler unless the severity is greater than 10.


* 0.4.5 *

* Better SYBEWRIT "Write to SQL Server failed." error handling. New Client#dead? check.

* Azure tested using latest FreeTDS with submitted patch. https://gist.github.com/889190


* 0.4.2 *

* Iconv is a dep only when compiling locally. However, left in the ability to configure
  it for native gem installation but you must use
  --enable-iconv before using --with-iconv-dir=/some/dir

* Really fix what 0.4.1 was supposed to do, force SYBDBLIB compile.


* 0.4.1 *

* Undefine MSDBLIB in case others have explicitly compiled FreeTDS with "MS db-lib source compatibility: yes".


* 0.4.0 *

* Allow SYBEICONVI errors to pass thru so that bad data is converted to ? marks.

* Build native deps using MiniPortile [Luis Lavena]

* Allow Result#fields to be called before iterating over the results.

* Two new client helper methods, #sqlsent? and #canceled?. Possible to use these to determine current
  state of the client and the need to use Result#cancel to stop processing active results. It is also
  safe to call Result#cancel over and over again.

* Look for the syb headers only.


* 0.3.2 *

* Small changes while testing JRuby. Using options hash for connect vs many args.


* 0.3.1 *
