## About TinyTDS

The TinyTDS gem is meant to serve the extremely common use-case of connecting, querying and iterating over results to Microsoft SQL Server from Ruby using the FreeTDS's DB-Library API.

TinyTDS offers automatic casting to Ruby primitives along with proper encoding support. It converts all SQL Server datatypes to native Ruby primitives while supporting :utc or :local time zones for time-like types. To date it is the only Ruby client library that allows client encoding options, defaulting to UTF-8, while connecting to SQL Server. It also  properly encodes all string and binary data.

The API is simple and consists of these classes:

* TinyTds::Client - Your connection to the database.
* TinyTds::Result - Returned from issuing an #execute on the connection. It includes Enumerable.
* TinyTds::Error - A wrapper for all FreeTDS exceptions.


## Install

tiny_tds is tested with Ruby v2.7 and upwards.

### Windows and Linux (64-bit)

We precompile tiny_tds with FreeTDS and supporting libraries, which are dynamically linked at runtime. Therefore, you can run:

```shell
gem install tiny_tds
```

It should find the platform-specific gem.

You can also avoid getting the platform-specific gem if you want to compile FreeTDS and supporting libraries yourself:

```shell
gem install tiny_tds --platform ruby
```

### Mac

Install FreeTDS via Homebrew:

```shell
brew install openssl@3 libiconv
brew install freetds
```

Then you can install tiny_tds:

```shell
gem install tiny_tds
```

### Everybody else

`tiny_tds` will find FreeTDS and other libraries based on your compiler paths. Below you can see an example on how to install FreeTDS on a Debian system.

```shell
$ apt-get install wget
$ apt-get install build-essential
$ apt-get install libc6-dev

$ wget http://www.freetds.org/files/stable/freetds-1.4.23.tar.gz
$ tar -xzf freetds-1.4.23.tar.gz
$ cd freetds-1.4.23
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-tdsver=7.4 --disable-odbc
$ make
$ make install
```

You can also tell `tiny_tds` where to find your FreeTDS installation.

```shell
gem install tiny_tds -- --with-freetds-dir=/opt/freetds
```

## Getting Started

Optionally, Microsoft has done a great job writing [an article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ruby/ruby-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16) on how to get started with SQL Server and Ruby using TinyTDS, however, the articles are using outdated versions.

## Data Types

Our goal is to support every SQL Server data type and convert it to a logical Ruby object. When dates or times are returned, they are instantiated to either `:utc` or `:local` time depending on the query options. Only [datetimeoffset] types are excluded. All strings are associated to the connection's encoding and all binary data types are associated to Ruby's `ASCII-8BIT/BINARY` encoding.

Below is a list of the data types we support when using the 7.4 TDS protocol version. Using a lower protocol version will result in these types being returned as strings.

* [date]
* [datetime2]
* [datetimeoffset]
* [time]


## TinyTds::Client Usage

Connect to a database.

```ruby
client = TinyTds::Client.new username: 'sa', password: 'secret', host: 'mydb.host.net'
```

Creating a new client takes a hash of options. For valid iconv encoding options, see the output of `iconv -l`. Only a few have been tested, and are highly recommended to leave blank for the UTF-8 default.

* :username - The database server user.
* :password - The user password.
* :dataserver - Can be the name for your data server as defined in freetds.conf. Raw hostname or hostname:port will work here too. FreeTDS says that a named instance like 'localhost\SQLEXPRESS' will work too, but I highly suggest that you use the :host and :port options below. [Google how to find your host port if you are using named instances](http://bit.ly/xAf2jm) or [go here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181087.aspx).
* :host - Used if :dataserver blank. Can be an host name or IP.
* :port - Defaults to 1433. Only used if :host is used.
* :database - The default database to use.
* :appname - Short string seen in SQL Servers process/activity window.
* :tds_version - TDS version. Defaults to "7.3".
* :login_timeout - Seconds to wait for login. Default to 60 seconds.
* :timeout - Seconds to wait for a response to a SQL command. Default 5 seconds. Timeouts caused by network failure will raise a timeout error 1 second after the configured timeout limit is hit (see [#481](https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/tiny_tds/pull/481) for details).
* :encoding - Any valid iconv value like CP1251 or ISO-8859-1. Default UTF-8.
* :azure - Pass true to signal that you are connecting to azure.
* :contained - Pass true to signal that you are connecting with a contained database user.
* :use_utf16 - Instead of using UCS-2 for database wide character encoding use UTF-16. Newer Windows versions use this encoding instead of UCS-2. Default true.
* :message_handler - Pass in a `call`-able object such as a `Proc` or a method to receive info messages from the database. It should have a single parameter, which will be a `TinyTds::Error` object representing the message. For example:

```ruby
opts = ... # host, username, password, etc
opts[:message_handler] = Proc.new { |m| puts m.message }
client = TinyTds::Client.new opts
# => Changed database context to 'master'.
# => Changed language setting to us_english.
client.execute("print 'hello world!'").do
# => hello world!
```

Use the `#active?` method to determine if a connection is good. The implementation of this method may change but it should always guarantee that a connection is good. Current it checks for either a closed or dead connection.

```ruby
client.dead?    # => false
client.closed?  # => false
client.active?  # => true
client.execute("SQL TO A DEAD SERVER")
client.dead?    # => true
client.closed?  # => false
client.active?  # => false
client.close
client.closed?  # => true
client.active?  # => false
```

Escape strings.

```ruby
client.escape("How's It Going'") # => "How''s It Going''"
```

Send a SQL string to the database and return a TinyTds::Result object.

```ruby
result = client.execute("SELECT * FROM [datatypes]")
```


## TinyTds::Result Usage

A result object is returned by the client's execute command. It is important that you either return the data from the query, most likely with the #each method, or that you cancel the results before asking the client to execute another SQL batch. Failing to do so will yield an error.

Calling #each on the result will lazily load each row from the database.

```ruby
result.each do |row|
  # By default each row is a hash.
  # The keys are the fields, as you'd expect.
  # The values are pre-built Ruby primitives mapped from their corresponding types.
end
```

A result object has a `#fields` accessor. It can be called before the result rows are iterated over. Even if no rows are returned, #fields will still return the column names you expected. Any SQL that does not return columned data will always return an empty array for `#fields`. It is important to remember that if you access the `#fields` before iterating over the results, the columns will always follow the default query option's `:symbolize_keys` setting at the client's level and will ignore the query options passed to each.

```ruby
result = client.execute("USE [tinytdstest]")
result.fields # => []
result.do

result = client.execute("SELECT [id] FROM [datatypes]")
result.fields # => ["id"]
result.cancel
result = client.execute("SELECT [id] FROM [datatypes]")
result.each(:symbolize_keys => true)
result.fields # => [:id]
```

You can cancel a result object's data from being loading by the server.

```ruby
result = client.execute("SELECT * FROM [super_big_table]")
result.cancel
```

You can use results cancelation in conjunction with results lazy loading, no problem.

```ruby
result = client.execute("SELECT * FROM [super_big_table]")
result.each_with_index do |row, i|
  break if row > 10
end
result.cancel
```

If the SQL executed by the client returns affected rows, you can easily find out how many.

```ruby
result.each
result.affected_rows # => 24
```

This pattern is so common for UPDATE and DELETE statements that the #do method cancels any need for loading the result data and returns the `#affected_rows`.

```ruby
result = client.execute("DELETE FROM [datatypes]")
result.do # => 72
```

Likewise for `INSERT` statements, the #insert method cancels any need for loading the result data and executes a `SCOPE_IDENTITY()` for the primary key.

```ruby
result = client.execute("INSERT INTO [datatypes] ([xml]) VALUES ('<html><br/></html>')")
result.insert # => 420
```

The result object can handle multiple result sets form batched SQL or stored procedures. It is critical to remember that when calling each with a block for the first time will return each "row" of each result set. Calling each a second time with a block will yield each "set".

```ruby
sql = ["SELECT TOP (1) [id] FROM [datatypes]",
       "SELECT TOP (2) [bigint] FROM [datatypes] WHERE [bigint] IS NOT NULL"].join(' ')

set1, set2 = client.execute(sql).each
set1 # => [{"id"=>11}]
set2 # => [{"bigint"=>-9223372036854775807}, {"bigint"=>9223372036854775806}]

result = client.execute(sql)

result.each do |rowset|
  # First time data loading, yields each row from each set.
  # 1st: {"id"=>11}
  # 2nd: {"bigint"=>-9223372036854775807}
  # 3rd: {"bigint"=>9223372036854775806}
end

result.each do |rowset|
  # Second time over (if columns cached), yields each set.
  # 1st: [{"id"=>11}]
  # 2nd: [{"bigint"=>-9223372036854775807}, {"bigint"=>9223372036854775806}]
end
```

Use the `#sqlsent?` and `#canceled?` query methods on the client to determine if an active SQL batch still needs to be processed and or if data results were canceled from the last result object. These values reset to true and false respectively for the client at the start of each `#execute` and new result object. Or if all rows are processed normally, `#sqlsent?` will return false. To demonstrate, lets assume we have 100 rows in the result object.

```ruby
client.sqlsent?   # = false
client.canceled?  # = false

result = client.execute("SELECT * FROM [super_big_table]")

client.sqlsent?   # = true
client.canceled?  # = false

result.each do |row|
  # Assume we break after 20 rows with 80 still pending.
  break if row["id"] > 20
end

client.sqlsent?   # = true
client.canceled?  # = false

result.cancel

client.sqlsent?   # = false
client.canceled?  # = true
```

It is possible to get the return code after executing a stored procedure from either the result or client object.

```ruby
client.return_code  # => nil

result = client.execute("EXEC tinytds_TestReturnCodes")
result.do
result.return_code  # => 420
client.return_code  # => 420
```


## Query Options

Every `TinyTds::Result` object can pass query options to the #each method. The defaults are defined and configurable by setting options in the `TinyTds::Client.default_query_options` hash. The default values are:

* :as => :hash - Object for each row yielded. Can be set to :array.
* :symbolize_keys => false - Row hash keys. Defaults to shared/frozen string keys.
* :cache_rows => true - Successive calls to #each returns the cached rows.
* :timezone => :local - Local to the Ruby client or :utc for UTC.
* :empty_sets => true - Include empty results set in queries that return multiple result sets.

Each result gets a copy of the default options you specify at the client level and can be overridden by passing an options hash to the #each method. For example

```ruby
result.each(:as => :array, :cache_rows => false) do |row|
  # Each row is now an array of values ordered by #fields.
  # Rows are yielded and forgotten about, freeing memory.
end
```

Besides the standard query options, the result object can take one additional option. Using `:first => true` will only load the first row of data and cancel all remaining results.

```ruby
result = client.execute("SELECT * FROM [super_big_table]")
result.each(:first => true) # => [{'id' => 24}]
```


## Row Caching

By default row caching is turned on because the SQL Server adapter for ActiveRecord would not work without it. I hope to find some time to create some performance patches for ActiveRecord that would allow it to take advantages of lazily created yielded rows from result objects. Currently only TinyTDS and the Mysql2 gem allow such a performance gain.


## Encoding Error Handling

TinyTDS takes an opinionated stance on how we handle encoding errors. First, we treat errors differently on reads vs. writes. Our opinion is that if you are reading bad data due to your client's encoding option, you would rather just find `?` marks in your strings vs being blocked with exceptions. This is how things wold work via ODBC or SMS. On the other hand, writes will raise an exception. In this case we raise the SYBEICONVO/2402 error message which has a description of `Error converting characters into server's character set. Some character(s) could not be converted.`. Even though the severity of this message is only a `4` and TinyTDS will automatically strip/ignore unknown characters, we feel you should know that you are inserting bad encodings. In this way, a transaction can be rolled back, etc. Remember, any database write that has bad characters due to the client encoding will still be written to the database, but it is up to you rollback said write if needed. Most ORMs like ActiveRecord handle this scenario just fine.


## Timeout Error Handling

TinyTDS will raise a `TinyTDS::Error` when a timeout is reached based on the options supplied to the client. Depending on the reason for the timeout, the connection could be dead or alive. When db processing is the cause for the timeout, the connection should still be usable after the error is raised. When network failure is the cause of the timeout, the connection will be dead. If you attempt to execute another command batch on a dead connection you will see a `DBPROCESS is dead or not enabled` error. Therefore, it is recommended to check for a `dead?` connection before trying to execute another command batch.

## Binstubs

The TinyTDS gem uses binstub wrappers which mirror compiled [FreeTDS Utilities](https://www.freetds.org/userguide/usefreetds.html) binaries. These native executables are usually installed at the system level when installing FreeTDS. However, when using MiniPortile to install TinyTDS as we do with Windows binaries, these binstubs will find and prefer local gem `exe` directory executables. These are the following binstubs we wrap.

* tsql - Used to test connections and debug compile time settings.
* defncopy - Used to dump schema structures.


## Using TinyTDS With Rails & The ActiveRecord SQL Server adapter.

TinyTDS is the default connection mode for the SQL Server adapter in versions 3.1 or higher. The SQL Server adapter can be found using the links below.

* ActiveRecord SQL Server Adapter: http://github.com/rails-sqlserver/activerecord-sqlserver-adapter


## Using TinyTDS with Azure

TinyTDS is fully tested with the Azure platform. You must set the `azure: true` connection option when connecting. This is needed to specify the default database name in the login packet since Azure has no notion of `USE [database]`. FreeTDS must be compiled with OpenSSL too.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not use `username@server.database.windows.net` for the username connection option! You must use the shorter `username@server` instead!

Also, please read the [Azure SQL Database General Guidelines and Limitations](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee336245.aspx) MSDN article to understand the differences. Specifically, the connection constraints section!

## Connection Settings

A DBLIB connection does not have the same default SET options for a standard SMS SQL Server connection. Hence, we recommend the following options post establishing your connection.

#### SQL Server

```sql
SET ANSI_DEFAULTS ON

SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
SET CURSOR_CLOSE_ON_COMMIT OFF
SET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS OFF
SET TEXTSIZE 2147483647
SET CONCAT_NULL_YIELDS_NULL ON
```

#### Azure

```sql
SET ANSI_NULLS ON
SET ANSI_NULL_DFLT_ON ON
SET ANSI_PADDING ON
SET ANSI_WARNINGS ON

SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON
SET CURSOR_CLOSE_ON_COMMIT OFF
SET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS OFF
SET TEXTSIZE 2147483647
SET CONCAT_NULL_YIELDS_NULL ON
```


## Thread Safety

TinyTDS must be used with a connection pool for thread safety. If you use ActiveRecord or the [Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel) gem this is done for you. However, if you are using TinyTDS on your own, we recommend using the ConnectionPool gem when using threads:

* ConnectionPool Gem - https://github.com/mperham/connection_pool

Please read our [thread_test.rb](https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/tiny_tds/blob/master/test/thread_test.rb) file for details on how we test its usage.


## Emoji Support 😍

This is possible. Since FreeTDS v1.0, utf-16 is enabled by default and supported by tiny_tds. You can toggle it by using `use_utf16` when establishing the connection.

## Development & Testing

First, clone the repo using the command line or your Git GUI of choice.

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:rails-sqlserver/tiny_tds.git
```

After that, the quickest way to get setup for development is to use the provided devcontainers setup.

```shell
npm install -g @devcontainers/cli
devcontainer up --workspace-folder .
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . bash
```

From within the container, you can run the tests using the following command:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec rake test
```

You can customize the environment variables to run the tests against a different environment

```shell 
rake test TINYTDS_UNIT_DATASERVER=mydbserver TINYTDS_SCHEMA=sqlserver_2017
rake test TINYTDS_UNIT_HOST=mydb.host.net TINYTDS_SCHEMA=sqlserver_azure
```

### Code formatting

We are using `standardrb` to format the Ruby code and Artistic Style for the C code. Run `bundle exec rake format` to format both types in one operation. Artistic Style needs to be manually installed through your package manager (e.g. `apt install -y astyle`).

### Compiling Gems for Windows and Linux

> [!WARNING]
> Compiling the Gems on native Windows currently does not work.

For the convenience, TinyTDS ships pre-compiled gems for supported versions of Ruby on Windows and Linux. In order to generate these gems, [rake-compiler-dock](https://github.com/rake-compiler/rake-compiler-dock) is used.

Run the following rake task to compile the gems. You can run these commands from inside the devcontainers setup, or outside if neeed. The command will check the availability of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and will give some advice for download and installation. When docker is running, it will download the docker image (once-only) and start the build:

```shell
bundle exec rake gem:native
```

The compiled gems will exist in `./pkg` directory.

If you only need a specific gem for one platform and architecture, run this command:

```shell
bundle exec rake gem:native:x64-mingw-ucrt
```

All the supported architectures and platforms are listed in the `Rakefile` in the `CrossLibraries` constant.
